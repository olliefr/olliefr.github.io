<p>This post is about trying to solve the following brain-teaser:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You toss a fair coin 400 times. What’s the probability that you get at least 220 heads? Round your answer to the nearest percent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each coin toss is an independent Bernoulli random variable parametrised by <script type="math/tex">p=\frac{1}{2}</script> since the coin is fair. We’ll call a single sequence of 400 tosses a single trial. It is a Binomial random variable with the probability mass function (PMF)</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p_{x}(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k \left(1-p\right)^{n-k}</script>

<p>This means, for example, that the probability of scoring <em>exactly</em> 220 heads is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p_{x}(220) = \binom{400}{220} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{220} \left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)^{400-220} = \frac{\binom{400}{220}}{2^{400}}</script>

<p>The final form of this expression can be interpreted as a number of ways to choose 220 heads from 400 tosses in the numerator over the total number of possible configurations in the denominator.</p>

<p>Herein comes the trouble. We would like to know the probability of the number of heads being <script type="math/tex">\ge 220</script>, not just <em>exactly</em> 220. In other words, we seek to compute the sum</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p_x(k \ge 220) = \sum^{400}_{k=220} p_x(k) = p_x(220) + p_x(221) + p_x(222) + \dots + p_x(400)</script>

<p>There is a handful of approaches one can take to solve this problem.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Run <script type="math/tex">1\,000\,000</script> trials, each of <script type="math/tex">400</script> tosses. Count how many trials scored <script type="math/tex">\ge 220</script> heads. This is the most direct approach, but how does one justify the chosen number of trials? This approach is also most computationally expensive, but as we will see it has its values as it is very easy to implement and it provides a good estimate for comparison with other methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sum <script type="math/tex">\sum^{400}_{k=220} p_x(k)</script> can be computed directly by iteration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A classic pencil and paper approach could use a normal approximation based on the central limit theorem. Statistical tables will be required to avoid any computer or calculator use. [One <em>could</em> avoid using tables and compute everything manually, for example by using Taylor expansions of <script type="math/tex">e^x</script> but we won’t go there.]</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="option-1-simulation">Option 1: Simulation</h1>

<p>The simulation does not require much understanding of the probabilistic model behind the problem. We just run <script type="math/tex">1\,000\,000</script> trials, <script type="math/tex">400</script> tosses in each, and find out how many of the trials scored more than <script type="math/tex">220</script> heads.</p>

<p>The first simulation is implemented in R:</p>

</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/fa1cf400a31dde223628b6891534ddde.js"> </script>

<p>I get the value of <script type="math/tex">0.03</script>, so the answer is <script type="math/tex">3\%</script>.</p>

<p>For no good reason at all, the same simulation crudely implemented in C++11:</p>

<noscript><pre>400: Invalid request
</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/afecc7ddde5ba8c9c51d9d4e509b6149.js"> </script>

<p>It runs slower than R version above, and a representative answer is <script type="math/tex">\approx 0.025317</script>, that is about <script type="math/tex">3\%</script>.</p>

<h1 id="option-2-sum-by-iteration">Option 2: Sum by Iteration</h1>

<p>For a more formal approach, consider the sum</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p_x(k \ge 220) = p_x(220) + p_x(221) + p_x(222) + \dots + p_x(400)</script>

<p>Since the Bernoulli probability for each toss <script type="math/tex">p=0.5</script> is fixed, the sum of probabilities can be reduced to the sum of binomial coefficients</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">p_x(k \ge 220) = 2^{-n} \sum_{k=220}^{400} \binom{n}{k}</script>

<p>This sum is easy to do on a computer.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/19c9e93cd2f6babae0b103feb7f63ab7.js"> </script>

<p>This code returns the value of <script type="math/tex">0.03</script>, or <script type="math/tex">3\%</script>. This result was computed much, much faster than using simulation, but the important thing here is that it’s the <em>same answer</em> obtained using <em>different methods</em>.</p>

<p>The C++ implementation would have to include a way to compute <script type="math/tex">\binom{n}{k}</script> since the standard library does not provide for it. Implementing it is a good exercise, since one cannot rely on the mathematical definition involving factorials – the result would overflow even for rather small values of <script type="math/tex">n</script>. (Knuth, 2011) has a lot more to say on this.</p>

<h1 id="option-3-normal-approximation-based-on-the-central-limit-theorem">Option 3: Normal Approximation Based on the Central Limit Theorem</h1>

<p>Since each coin toss <script type="math/tex">X_i</script> is an independent Bernoulli rendom variable and all tosses in a trial are identically distributed with mean <script type="math/tex">\mu = \frac{1}{2}</script> and variance <script type="math/tex">\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{4}</script>, we can try to pretend that the sum <script type="math/tex">S_n = \sum^{400}_{i=1} X_i </script> of such variables is normally distributed.</p>

<p>Then we can compute the mean of this sum</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mu_S = n \mu = 400 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 200</script>

<p>And also its variance</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sigma^2_n = n \sigma^2 = 400 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 100</script>

<p>Now we could use the approximation</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P\left(S_n \le c \right) \approx \Phi\left(z\right)</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\Phi\left(z\right)</script> is available from <em>standard</em> normal CDF tables.</p>

<p>If you think of it in terms of area under the graph, we would like to know the area of a slice between 220 and 400, or in other words the difference in the value of the CDF at these locations.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P\left( 220 \le S_n \le 400 \right) = 1 - P\left( 219 \le S_n \right)</script>

<p>Two points must be noted. Firstly, <script type="math/tex">P\left( S_n \le 400 \right) = 1</script>, since there is only <script type="math/tex">n=400</script> tosses in a trial. Secondly, we have to be careful when moving from discrete to continuous world – we would like to include <script type="math/tex">P\left( S_n = 220 \right)</script> into our answer, so the last (discrete) value to exclude is <script type="math/tex">S_n = 219</script>.</p>

<p>The CDF tables are normalised, so let’s normalise the value of <script type="math/tex">z</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">z = \frac{c -n\mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 n}} = \frac{219 - 200}{\sqrt{100}} = \frac{19}{10} = 1.9</script>

<p>My tables (Lindley D.V. &amp; Scott W.F., 2008) state that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi\left( 1.9 \right) \approx 0.9713</script>

<p>so the answer comes to</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P\left( 220 \le S_n \le 400 \right) \approx 1 - 0.9713 = 0.0287</script>

<p>Rounding this value to the nearest percent, the final answer is <script type="math/tex">3\%</script>, as before.</p>

<p>The normal approximation works so well because, to quote (Bersekas &amp; Tsitsiklis, 2008, p. 279),</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When <script type="math/tex">p</script> is close to <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{2}</script>, in which case the PMF of <script type="math/tex">X_i</script> is symmetric, the […] formula yields a very good approximation for <script type="math/tex">n</script> as low as <script type="math/tex">40</script> or <script type="math/tex">50</script>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was pencil and paper (and statistical tables) approach. We can do the same thing in software to verify the answer.</p>

<p>This code returns the value of <script type="math/tex">0.03</script>, or <script type="math/tex">3\%</script>, same as before.</p>

<p>There we have it!</p>

<h1 id="conclusions-and-meditations">Conclusions and Meditations</h1>

<p>Despite my education in mathematical modelling, I still get excited when a crude simulation turns out to be helpful for guiding more theoretical work. Such was the case this time as well – the simple simulation as the first option has prevented me from making an <em>order-of-magnitude</em> sized error in my theoretical derivations later.</p>

<p>If you read this far, thanks, and any comments/suggestions are welcome.</p>
